Contains ideas to workon 

## Vision

The basic idea is to develop the tool that enables to get detailed audio and text description of a real time surrounding and is not prone to networking casulaties and is independently functioning standalone system.

Used approaches and Technology

    1. Convolutional neural network
    2. Recurrent neural network
    3. Image and Video processing

## AUGMENTED REALITY

Kids can learn with interactive models which can be brought in reality with the help of AR. They can not only see but also interact with models.
Tech Stack Used :

    Unity
    Android Studio
    Vuforia
    AR Core

# Attendance System Using Facial Recognition.

Facial recognition is a type of biometric technology that uses statistical measurements of people's features to digitally determine identity. The system is developed for deploying an easy and a secure way of taking down attendance.
Why Facial recognition you may ask?

    Face recognition is time efficient.
    Face recognition can be used in many work environment.
    Fast and Accurate.
    Cheap and Easy Installation.
    Does not store personal data.

# Web App Creation Portal (Template)

The twenty-first century digital world enabled mobile, empowered, content-hungry individuals to capture the value of enabling technologies and applications to manage, create, share, and influence content across the creation and delivery spectrum. Users were online in record numbers, spending a greater percentage of their time, and conducting more and more activities including communications, learning, entertainment, and social interaction. Digital technologies and broadband radically revolutionized the value equation for many industries, giving more influence and power to the individual.      

Tech Stack to be used:

          1. Python
          2. HTML template
          3.Dynamic Nosql
          
# Smart Security Surveillance System
Objectives:

          1.Developing a centralised mainframe
            It will be installed on a single centralised machine where the main algorithm will be running and the database is             accessed. This will be connected to the nodes from which the authorized personnel will get access to the system.
            
          2.Algorithm-Human identification and tracking system

            The algorithm will detect humans in the cctv footage frames and will search the database for identification                   of people in the live video footage. If there is one person of interest in the live feed, there will be an option             to select that individual and only track activities of that person. After tracking, the algorithm will upload the             logs of tracking to the database, in the tracked person/people’s records.
            
          3.Software system for each node: To be installed in individual systems or ‘nodes’. Here, authorized personnel will             perform operations. As per login credentials, access rights will be defined for the user.

              CCTV surveillance system provides the real-time recording as well as online access by the staff to monitor more               i ntelligently that would eventually reduce the risk of crime.
